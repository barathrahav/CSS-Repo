                    <caption>Adani Ports starts $130 million buyback of debt securities</caption>
                    <hr>
                    <p>&emsp;Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone, a group company of the beleaguered Adani Group, said on April 24 that it started a buyback programme of certain debt securities to prepay part of its loans due in 2024. 
                            Adani Ports has floated a tender of up to $130 million in outstanding debt, it said in an exchange filing, as it seeks to boost investor confidence after the group's shares were pummelled earlier this year by a U.S. short-seller's report. </p>

                            <p>&emsp;Mahendra Singh Dhoni believes that during Kolkata Knight Riders' next IPL game, the Eden Gardens will witness the familiar purple hue but Sunday was about “his farewell”, in what could be his last appearance on the hallowed turf. Having first stepped on this iconic ground as a teenager, who played Ranji Trophy for Bihar, Kolkata's favourite son-in-law has a manic fan base as one saw Eden Gardens filled with yellow jersey, anticipating that they might not see the special man again.</p>

                    <hr>
                    <p>&emsp;An Income Tax Department team launched checks at the offices of G. Square Real Estate Developers in Tiruchi and Coimbatore on Monday, April 24.
                        In Tiruchi, a four-member I-T team, including one woman official, entered the office, situated in a commercial complex in the Cantonment area on Monday morning. The checks are underway, said police sources. 
                        In Coimbatore, I-T officials searched the office of the G Square Group in Peelamedu on Avinashi Road. Sources said that around 10 I-T sleuths, who came in three cars, began the search at the office.
                        The I-T Department also searched the house of Mahendra Ramdas, managing director of Mahendra Pumps Ltd, near Puliyakulam in Coimbatore, added the sources.</p>

                    <span>T.N. introduces special licence for serving liquor in marriage halls, <br>stadiums and house functions</span>
                    <div class="img4" align="left"><img src="Scotch2lead.jpeg" width="100%" height="240px"></div>
                    <p>The Tamil Nadu government has introduced a special licence by amending the Tamil Nadu Liquor (Licence and Permit) Rules, 1981, to facilitate possession and serving of liquor on commercial premises, such as marriage halls, banquet halls and sports stadiums, as well as non-commercial premises such as households hosting celebrations, functions and parties.
                        The special licence is aimed at facilitating the serving of liquor to guests, visitors and participants at public events at a place specified by the licensee and the licensor. So far, licences were issued only for clubs and star hotels. A notification on the special licence was issued by the Home, Prohibition and Excise Department last month.
                        F.L.12 special licence would be valid for one or more days and would be issued by the Deputy Commissioner/Assistant Commissioner (Excise) with the approval of the Collector on payment of licence fees. This special licence was aimed at filling the gap.
